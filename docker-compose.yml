    #Janus will bind to ports 80, 7088, 7089, 7188, 7189, 8088, 8089, 8188 and 8189 by default. (Apache demo page, http(s) Admin API, http(s) Janus API, ws(s) Janus Websocket API)
    #The ports can be changed by changing them in the janus.jcfg and the according transport.jcfg
    #Don't forget to expose/not-expose the ports you changed in the Dockerfile and/or in the docker-compose.yml
